# Integrated Preamp Pedal Clone

I designed a PCB for a clone of TC Electronic's classic Integrated Preamp guitar pedal. It provides up to 30dB of clean boost, with bass and treble controls.

The circuit is the same as the original TC Electronic pedal except for the power supply, which uses a charge pump to generate a 30V power rail from the standard 9V external DC input.
